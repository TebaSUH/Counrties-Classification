# Countries Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project presents an image classification system that distinguishes between three countries—Japan, France, and Mexico—using street-level imagery from a Hugging Face dataset. The model is based on a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which applies transformer-based attention mechanisms to visual data.

The objective was to train and evaluate the model’s ability to learn meaningful geographic features from images and to analyze its performance through training and validation metrics. The project demonstrates how transformer architectures can be effectively applied to computer vision tasks and emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve strong generalization performance.
